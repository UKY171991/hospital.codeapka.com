Notes:
- All responses follow {success: boolean, data|message: ...}
- save/delete require an active session with role 'admin' or 'master'.
- For external testing with Postman, you may simulate a session by calling the webapp login first and exporting cookies, or adapt the API to accept a token (not implemented).
