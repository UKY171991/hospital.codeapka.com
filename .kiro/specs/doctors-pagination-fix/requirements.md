# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix the pagination functionality on the doctors.php page where all data is not showing properly and pagination controls are not working as expected. The system should properly implement server-side pagination using DataTables to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Glossary

- **DataTables**: A jQuery plugin that provides advanced interaction controls for HTML tables
- **Server-side Processing**: A DataTables feature that handles pagination, sorting, and filtering on the server rather than client-side
- **Doctors System**: The web application module that manages doctor records in the hospital management system
- **AJAX API**: The server-side endpoint that handles data requests and responses for the doctors table

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hospital administrator, I want to see all doctor records with proper pagination, so that I can navigate through large datasets efficiently.

3. WHEN a user clicks on a page number, THE Doctors System SHALL load and display the corresponding page of doctor records
4. WHEN a user changes the number of records per page, THE Doctors System SHALL update the display accordingly
5. THE Doctors System SHALL show the correct total count of records and current page information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a hospital administrator, I want the table to load quickly regardless of the total number of doctors, so that the system remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Doctors System SHALL implement server-side processing for pagination to handle large datasets
2. WHEN loading any page of data, THE Doctors System SHALL respond within 3 seconds

5. THE Doctors System SHALL preserve the current page when applying filters where possible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a hospital administrator, I want to search through doctor records while maintaining pagination, so that I can find specific doctors efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN search results span multiple pages, THE Doctors System SHALL show appropriate pagination controls
3. THE Doctors System SHALL maintain search terms when navigating between pages
