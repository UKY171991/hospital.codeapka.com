# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The hospital management system's entry-list.php page has multiple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation failures that prevent proper management of test entries. Users are experiencing issues with creating new entries, viewing entry details, editing existing entries, and deleting entries. The system needs comprehensive fixes to ensure all CRUD operations work correctly and reliably.
