# Test Management System Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the laboratory test management system in the hospital pathology module. The system manages laboratory tests, their categories, reference ranges, and provides a comprehensive interface for healthcare professionals to manage test data efficiently.

## Glossary

- **Test Management System**: The web-based interface for managing laboratory tests
- **Laboratory Test**: A medical test performed on patient samples with specific reference ranges
- **Test Category**: A classification system for organizing tests (e.g., Blood Tests, Urine Tests)
- **Main Category**: Top-level categorization (e.g., Laboratory Tests, Radiology)
- **Reference Range**: Normal value ranges for test results, which may vary by gender and age
- **DataTable**: Interactive table component for displaying and managing test data
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for test management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a laboratory technician, I want to view all laboratory tests in a clean, organized table, so that I can quickly find and manage test information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test management page loads, THE Test Management System SHALL display a table with exactly 6 columns: Checkbox, ID, Test Name, Category, Price, and Actions
2. WHEN test data is loading, THE Test Management System SHALL show a loading indicator without causing layout issues
3. WHEN no tests are available, THE Test Management System SHALL display a clear "No tests found" message
4. WHEN the table is displayed, THE Test Management System SHALL show test names prominently with description previews
5. WHEN category information is shown, THE Test Management System SHALL display both main category and test category with distinct visual styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a healthcare administrator, I want to add new laboratory tests with complete information, so that the system maintains accurate test data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Add New Test", THE Test Management System SHALL open a modal form with all required fields
2. WHEN I select a main category, THE Test Management System SHALL automatically load corresponding test categories
3. WHEN I fill in test information, THE Test Management System SHALL validate required fields before submission
4. WHEN I save a new test, THE Test Management System SHALL add the test and refresh the table without layout issues
5. WHEN reference ranges are entered, THE Test Management System SHALL support gender-specific and age-specific ranges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a laboratory supervisor, I want to edit existing test information, so that I can keep test data current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the edit button for a test, THE Test Management System SHALL open the edit modal with all current test data populated
2. WHEN the edit modal opens, THE Test Management System SHALL correctly select the main category and load corresponding test categories
3. WHEN I modify test information, THE Test Management System SHALL validate changes before saving
4. WHEN I save changes, THE Test Management System SHALL update the test and refresh the table display
5. WHEN editing is complete, THE Test Management System SHALL maintain the current table state and pagination

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a laboratory technician, I want to view detailed test information, so that I can see all test parameters and reference ranges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the view button for a test, THE Test Management System SHALL open a detailed view modal
2. WHEN the view modal opens, THE Test Management System SHALL display test information in organized sections
3. WHEN reference ranges exist, THE Test Management System SHALL show gender-specific and age-specific ranges in a clear table format
4. WHEN viewing test details, THE Test Management System SHALL show all metadata including creation and modification information
5. WHEN I want to edit from the view modal, THE Test Management System SHALL provide a direct edit option

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a healthcare administrator, I want to filter and search tests efficiently, so that I can quickly locate specific tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the category filter, THE Test Management System SHALL show only tests matching the selected category
2. WHEN I enter a price filter, THE Test Management System SHALL show only tests within the specified price range
3. WHEN I use the quick search, THE Test Management System SHALL filter tests in real-time as I type
4. WHEN I clear filters, THE Test Management System SHALL reset all filters and show all tests
5. WHEN filters are applied, THE Test Management System SHALL maintain filter state during table operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a laboratory supervisor, I want to perform bulk operations on tests, so that I can efficiently manage multiple tests at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select multiple tests using checkboxes, THE Test Management System SHALL show bulk action options
2. WHEN I click "Select All", THE Test Management System SHALL select all visible tests
3. WHEN I perform bulk export, THE Test Management System SHALL export selected tests in the chosen format
4. WHEN I perform bulk delete, THE Test Management System SHALL confirm the action before deletion
5. WHEN bulk operations complete, THE Test Management System SHALL update the display and show appropriate feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the interface to be responsive and work on different devices, so that I can access the system from various platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the system on a mobile device, THE Test Management System SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout
