# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The hospital management system's email compose functionality is experiencing issues with emails being delivered to recipients' spam folders instead of their inbox. This significantly impacts communication effectiveness with patients, staff, and external contacts. The system needs enhanced email deliverability features to ensure legitimate emails reach their intended recipients' inboxes.

- **DMARC_Policy**: Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance policy
- **Email_Headers**: Metadata fields in email messages that provide routing and authentication information
- **Reputation_Score**: A measure of sender trustworthiness used by email providers
