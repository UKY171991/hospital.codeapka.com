# DataTable Initialization Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for fixing the critical DataTable initialization error in the test management system. The current error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'style')" prevents the test table from loading properly, making the system unusable for test management operations.

## Glossary

- **DataTable**: jQuery DataTables plugin used for displaying tabular data with interactive features
- **Test Management System**: The web interface for managing laboratory tests in the hospital pathology module
- **Table Manager**: JavaScript module responsible for initializing and managing DataTable instances
- **DOM Element**: HTML elements in the document that DataTables attempts to manipulate
- **Initialization Error**: Runtime error that occurs when DataTables cannot properly initialize due to missing or malformed DOM elements

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a laboratory technician, I want the test management table to load without errors, so that I can view and manage laboratory tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test management page loads, THE Test Management System SHALL initialize the DataTable without throwing JavaScript errors
2. WHEN the table initialization completes, THE Test Management System SHALL display the table with proper column headers and structure
3. WHEN the DataTable is ready, THE Test Management System SHALL load test data and display it in the table
4. WHEN initialization fails, THE Test Management System SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback display options
5. WHEN the page is refreshed, THE Test Management System SHALL consistently initialize the table without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling for table initialization, so that I can diagnose and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DataTable initialization encounters an error, THE Test Management System SHALL log detailed error information to the console
2. WHEN DOM elements are missing or malformed, THE Test Management System SHALL detect and report the specific issue
3. WHEN initialization fails, THE Test Management System SHALL attempt graceful recovery or provide manual retry options
4. WHEN errors occur, THE Test Management System SHALL preserve user data and prevent data loss
5. WHEN debugging is needed, THE Test Management System SHALL provide comprehensive diagnostic information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust table initialization logic, so that the system handles edge cases and prevents future initialization errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the table HTML structure is incomplete, THE Test Management System SHALL validate and rebuild the structure before initialization
2. WHEN existing DataTable instances exist, THE Test Management System SHALL properly destroy them before creating new instances
3. WHEN DOM elements are not ready, THE Test Management System SHALL wait for proper DOM state before initialization
4. WHEN CSS or JavaScript resources are not loaded, THE Test Management System SHALL detect and handle missing dependencies
5. WHEN multiple initialization attempts occur, THE Test Management System SHALL prevent conflicts and ensure single instance creation
