# Added "Added By" Column to Entry List Table

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Entry API (`umakant/ajax/entry_api.php`)
- **List Action**: Added `u.username AS added_by_username` to the SQL query with `LEFT JOIN users u ON e.added_by = u.id`
- **Get Action**: Added the same join and field to the single entry query
- This ensures the API returns the username of who added each entry

### 2. Updated Entry List Page (`umakant/entry-list.php`)

#### Table Header
- Added "Added By" column to the table header between "Status" and "Actions"
- New column order: ID, Patient, Doctor, Test, Entry Date, Result, Unit, Status, **Added By**, Actions

#### JavaScript Functions
- **loadEntries()**: Updated colspan from 9 to 10 for loading and error messages
- **populateEntriesTable()**: 
  - Updated "no entries" message colspan from 9 to 10
  - Added new table cell displaying `entry.added_by_username` with styling `<span class="text-muted small">`
  - Shows "-" if no username is available

## Result
The entry list table now displays:
- **Added By** column showing the username of who created each entry
- Proper responsive design maintained
- Consistent styling with other table columns
- Graceful fallback ("-") when username is not available

## Benefits
1. **Accountability**: Now you can see who created each test entry
2. **Audit Trail**: Better tracking of data entry activities  
3. **Data Quality**: Helps identify patterns in data entry by different users
4. **Duplicate Investigation**: Can see if duplicates are from same user or different users

The table will now show who added each of those "Test 1" entries, making it easier to identify and resolve duplicate data issues.
